# Keyjoy

This is a hardware "virtual controller" for the Teensy4.1. It allows you to
connect a keyboard to the Teensy using its USB Host capabilities and translate
them so you can have your keyboard act as a controller. The motivation behind
this being allowing two people to play fighting games on keyboard at once
without conflicting binds and to ease setup for games with poor keyboard
support.
